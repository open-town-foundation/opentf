Open Town Foundation exists to provide an open source plan for an entire town.  
Our intention is to democratise governance, and bring decisions to the open source community for scrutiny and improvement.  
Our hope is to see our project break ground and become the world's first community designed and owned township, with more human centric living conditions.  

## Getting Started

We recommend you bring yourself up to speed with the goals in this Readme before contributing. If you want to contribute an idea or recommendation of any kind, please raise an issue or open a pull request.  

### Introduction

Over the years, we have seen a shift towards metropolitan living. Today, around 55 percent of the worldâ€™s population is thought to be living in an urban area or city, with that figure set to rise to 68 percent over the coming decades, according to the UN. In 2018 and immediately following, there was a global movement to recognise and begin to make an international effort towards combatting climate change, started by Swedish Activist Greta Thunberg.  

As we look back at where we have come from, what we have made, and the trajectory we see, it is clear that our lives are too wasteful. It's clear that we measure our worth in numbers that don't benefit the humans it was intended to describe, and that with time we will see a major deficit in jobs available for the number of people on this planet through inevitable market forces such as automation.  

There are many iniatives across the world to address various parts of this crisis we are awakening ourselves to. We have companies such as SpaceX paving the way to reuseable space flight, massively lowering the cost, and Tesla lowering the climate impact of personal transportation and energy technologies by revolutinising a stagnant worldwide industry.  
We have more social engagement with accountability for what we use and what we waste, with zero-waste and dietary changes happening in Western cultures. With the internet and mobile broadband empowering billions globally to have access to a wealth of information and knowledge, there is more awareness than ever of our local and global politics. We now have projects such as DIF, which will help bring about the end to manipulated voter systems seen in the richest and poorest countries of the world.  
We have the Paris agreement, and other emerging pacts to join governmental efforts in saving our fragile ecosystem.  

All of these are important projects, with different scales and focus.  

We believe one of the largest gaps in how we feel about and engage with the world, and a hole in the global roadmap, is an idea that addresses an increasing feeling of disenfranchisement within our local communities and the way we live.  
A habitat is defined as the natural home of a living being. One of the unshakable feelings is that living in a city isn't what we want for our whole lives. There is a lack of connection with nature, a feeling that we are absorbed into a machine and we become a gear, fighting against the pressures that surround us.  
Without a space to call our own, without knowing our closest neighbours, the world becomes a more fearful place, and this feeling drives sepratism and conservative actions. This has happened due to the sardine-like-living; we live in boxes, surrounded by other boxes, in increasingly small spaces. High rises are subpar living conditions[1], so providing alternatives is a top priority for the general wellbeing of all humans.  
A craving for 'peace and quiet' grows with time and living in this manner increases depression in women, and withdrawl and agression in men[2]  
It is our belief that one of the most fundamental human rights is shelter, and we need to design for human satisfaction, not efficiency of cost or space foremost.  

This project is our attempt at designing this habitat, and we have brought this before the open source community to correct the mistakes we've already made, and ensure our direction stays in the best interests of everyone both that may one day live in a town designed by OTF, and also the global population however they are impacted.  


### The Opportunity

* We believe that there is a desire to live outside of a traditional city lifestyle, closer to nature and closer with your local community.
* We believe that people have an inherent right to control the environment in which they live, to voice preferences and enact change for the better of a collective.
* We believe that open, collaborative planning leads to better, more detailed guidelines, and leads to correcting mistakes that were made in the past.
* We believe that people want an escape from sardine can living conditions.
* We believe that people want to fix what is broken, so it is better to propose a flawed plan than no plan at all.
* We believe that towns can be more ethical, better suited to the people living in them, with less waste, more indivdual control and better living conditions, without causing as much harm to the environment.
